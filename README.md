# Java-Inventory-with-GUI-buttons
A console based inventory that also uses GUI buttons. A user can click on the buttons (commands) and then enter, store, find, delete, and read entries from the respective file. The entries are sorted before saving so a person can see a sorted view when listing them with "List" button/command.
